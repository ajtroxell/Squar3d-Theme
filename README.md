##Setup
If you have never installed a custom WordPress theme before, check out [Using Themes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes) on WordPress.org. If you have previously installed themes then this should be no problem for you.

1. Upload the themes/folders within the SQUAR3D Theme folder to the wp-content » themes directory on your server.
2. Activate it via the Dashboard.
3. In Appearance » Menus, create two menus. One for your header navigation, and one for your social icons in the footer.
  1. The menu for header nav can contain any links you wish, but it is a good idea to include a link to your home page.
  2. The menu for your social icons requires that you enter a class for each item, in order for the icons to show.
  3. The social icon classes available to you are rss, facebook, lastfm, delicious, deviantart, evernote, vimeo, linkedin, youtube, dribbble, digg, googleplus, flickr, twitter, and tumblr, written exactly as seen here.
  4. For example: Create a custom menu item for your RSS feed with the appropriate link to your feed. Once the menu item is added to the menu, click the arrow icon on your new item, next to the text that reads Custom. Add the class rss to the field with the label of CSS Classes (optional). <small>Note: If you do not see the CSS Classes field, click Screen Options at the top-right of the window and check off CSS Classes underneath the text that reads Show advanced menu properties.</small>
  5. Save your menus, and then assign them to the appropriate area in the Theme Locations box, and then click Save.
4. Visit Appearance » Widgets and start adding your Widgets. All the work is done for you, minus any styling on the Search Widget as there is a search field in the header of the theme already.
